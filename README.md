## Feature Breakdown

### Objective
Detail the key features of the **Airbnb Clone** project and explain how each contributes to the overall functionality of the system.

---

### 1. User Management  
This feature allows users to create accounts, log in securely, and manage their profiles. It includes role-based access control, ensuring that property owners and guests have different permissions within the platform.

---

### 2. Property Management  
Property owners can add, update, and remove property listings. Each listing includes details such as title, description, price per night, and location, allowing guests to easily browse and find suitable accommodations.

---

### 3. Booking System  
Guests can search for available properties and make bookings for specific dates. The system handles availability checks, prevents double bookings, and tracks the booking status from pending to confirmed or canceled.

---

### 4. Review and Rating System  
After completing a stay, guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties. This feature helps maintain transparency, build trust, and assist other users in making informed booking decisions.

---

### 5. Payment Integration  
The payment system allows users to securely pay for bookings using different payment methods. It ensures that each transaction is recorded, verified, and linked to the correct booking for accountability and smooth financial management.

---

### 6. Notifications and Messaging  
This feature enables users to receive notifications about booking confirmations, cancellations, and payments. It may also support direct communication between property owners and guests for better coordination.

---

### 7. Search and Filtering  
Guests can search properties using filters such as location, price range, and amenities. This enhances user experience by allowing quick discovery of properties that meet specific preferences.

---

### 8. Admin Dashboard  
Administrators can monitor platform activity, manage users, and oversee listings and transactions. This feature helps maintain the system’s integrity, prevent misuse, and ensure smooth operations.

## API Security

### Objective
Understand the importance of securing the backend APIs and protecting sensitive data throughout the system.

---

### Key Security Measures

#### 1. Authentication  
Authentication ensures that only verified users can access the system.  
- **Implementation:** Users will log in using secure tokens (e.g., JWT – JSON Web Tokens).  
- **Importance:** Prevents unauthorized access and ensures that every request comes from a valid user.

---

#### 2. Authorization  
Authorization defines what each authenticated user is allowed to do.  
- **Implementation:** Role-based access control (RBAC) will be used to separate permissions between guests, property owners, and administrators.  
- **Importance:** Protects sensitive actions (like deleting listings or processing payments) from being accessed by unauthorized users.

---

#### 3. Data Encryption  
Data transmitted between the frontend and backend will be encrypted using HTTPS and SSL/TLS protocols.  
- **Implementation:** Secure connections will be enforced on all API endpoints.  
- **Importance:** Protects user credentials, payment data, and personal information from being intercepted or stolen.

---

#### 4. Rate Limiting  
Rate limiting controls how many API requests a user can make within a certain period.  
- **Implementation:** Use tools like Django REST Framework throttling or API gateways to prevent abuse.  
- **Importance:** Prevents denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and helps maintain server stability.

---

#### 5. Input Validation and Sanitization  
All incoming data will be validated before processing.  
- **Implementation:** Validate form inputs and API requests to reject unexpected or malicious data.  
- **Importance:** Prevents security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and data corruption.

---

#### 6. Secure Payment Processing  
All payment-related transactions will be handled through verified third-party gateways.  
- **Implementation:** Integrate trusted payment APIs that comply with PCI-DSS standards.  
- **Importance:** Ensures financial data remains confidential and transactions are securely handled.

---

#### 7. Logging and Monitoring  
The system will log important activities and monitor suspicious behavior.  
- **Implementation:** Use monitoring tools to detect failed login attempts or unauthorized access patterns.  
- **Importance:** Helps identify and respond quickly to potential security breaches.
